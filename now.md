# What I'm Doing Now

## Actively Searching for an Impactful Career Path
I am largely convinced by the case for [long-termism](https://80000hours.org/articles/future-generations/) as a defining moral framework. I haven't been able to determine what career change best exemplifies these principles, and it certainly keeps me up at night. I am currently leaning towards the broad field of [Global Priorities Research](https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/global-priorities-research/) or the narrower field of complexity economics. I am in the second semester of the MIT [Data, Economics, and Development Policy Micromasters](https://micromasters.mit.edu/dedp/) as a means of career exploration.

## Engineer at General Atomics
My work time is split between six to ten different projects across the domains of water, air, and space systems. The aspects that I most enjoy tend to fall into the realm of conceptual vehicle design and high level system modeling.

## Living in San Diego
My wonderful ~~fianc√©~~ wife and I are currently living in Mission Bay, San Diego. We are on the lookout for a new place to live to facilitate the adoption of a dog.
