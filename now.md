# What I'm Doing Now

## Center for Effective Aid Policy
I recently co-founded the [Center for Effective Aid Policy](http://aidpolicy.org/) with the one and only [Mathias Bonde](https://dk.linkedin.com/in/mathias-kirk-bonde?trk=people-guest_people_search-card). We met in the [Charity Entrepeneurship](https://www.charityentrepreneurship.com/) incubation program. We hope to move some international development aid in a positive direction!

## Living in San Diego
My wonderful wife, our dog Daisy, and I currently live in a neighborhood in Tierrasanta, San Diego. We are expecting our first child in September! I like to spend my free time playing pickup active team sports like soccer, volleyball, and ultimate frisbee.
