# What I'm Doing Now

## Actively Searching for an Impactful Career Path
I am largely convinced by the case for [long-termism](https://80000hours.org/articles/future-generations/) as a defining moral framework. I haven't been able to determine what career change best exemplifies these principles, and it certainly keeps me up at night. I am currently leaning towards the broad field of [Global Priorities Research](https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/global-priorities-research/) or something else aligned with the tenets of [Effective Altruism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_altruism). 

## Aerospace Engineer at General Atomics
My work time is split between three to five different projects across the domains of water, air, and space systems. The aspects that I most enjoy tend to fall into the realm of conceptual vehicle design and high level system modeling.

## Expanding Intellectual Horizons
I am trying to round out my rather technical education into something that encourages a more comprehensive view of the world. I am currently participating in a reading group with the [Catherine Project](https://catherineproject.org/) where we are reading Tocqueville's Democracy in America and hosting a parallel reading group with friends at home. 

## Living in San Diego
My wonderful wife and I are currently living in Mission Bay, San Diego. We are on the lookout for a new place. I like to spend my free time playing pickup team sports like soccer, volleyball, and ultimate frisbee.
