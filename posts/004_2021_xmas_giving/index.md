Similar to last year, each gift recipient will receive giving dollars and a one-pager on a specific charity to pitch. After the pitches and ensuing discussion the recipients will be allowed to allocate their giving dollars as they see fit. The winning charity with the most allocated dollars will have its donation doubled!

This year I am tweaking the format slightly - each recipient will be assigned two charities and they will be required to select one of the two to pitch. The intent here is to allow the recipients to perform an initial evaluation before coming up with selling points for their charity. We'll see how it goes.

We tried this for the first time with my family last year (2020) and it led to some interesting Christmas dinner conversation and some surprising results. Looking forward to seeing the results this year!
