I find *lists of favorite things* made by individuals I respect, and strive to think more similarly to, incredibly useful sources of discovery. Here are some of these lists I've used for identifying books to read:
* [Rob Wiblin](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1A8NdLoenjamLfnve7c6u8AI3X49MbORQDhZj4BpJvdY/edit)
* [Nick Beckstead](https://www.nickbeckstead.com/audiobooks)
* [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/book)

In a similar vein, I've attempted to keep a list of scored and ranked books I've read. The 1-4 stars scale roughly reflects:

* 4 - Among the best
* 3 - Glad to have read
* 2 - Good, but would not read again
* 1 - Would not recommend
