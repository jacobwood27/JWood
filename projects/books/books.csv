The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich: A History of Nazi Germany,William L. Shirer,2021/01/20,"It only takes one bad actor. Someone as charismatic as Hitler will draw a following, especially if they are fanatical and preaching to a disenfranchised populace. It is not easy to find a solution to the trap that came from Hitler’s rise to power – appeasement certainly didn’t work but kneecapping probably kicked everything off to start with. I think you could argue Hitler was a strident utilitarian who believed the world would take on its best form if he was successful; value alignment is important.",audio,4,4.15
"Thinking, Fast and Slow",Daniel Kahneman,2020/10/30,"Much of human reasoning is described well by the paradigms of System 1 (fast, automatic) and System 2 (slow, effortful). Beware of the many biases and pitfalls that are inherent to the structure of the human mind.",audio,4,4.16

The Precipice: Existential Risk and the Future of Humanity,Toby  Ord,2020/12/09,"Longtermism is very convincing, and urgent.

Master of the Senate,Robert A. Caro,2021/03/04,Much of policy is driven by personal ties and relationships. I also found myself focusing on how much I disliked LBJ on personal grounds and trying to dislike his politics because of who he was even though I largely admire his politics.

A Promised Land,Barack Obama,2021/05/27,It is really hard to be both an idealist and pragmatic in American democracy.
