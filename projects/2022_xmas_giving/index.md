Each gift recipient will receives giving dollars and a one-pager on two specific charities. The recipients pick one of the charities to pitch to the group. After the pitches and ensuing discussion the recipients will be allowed to allocate their giving dollars as they see fit. The winning charity with the most allocated dollars will have its donation doubled!
