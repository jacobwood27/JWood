*question: Imagine I gave you a "SKIP TOMORROW" button. When pressed, this button would cause you to be instantly transported 24 hours into the future. You still do all the things you would normally do (so nobody else can tell any difference), and remember the day normally, you just don't experience it. Afterwards, you forget you pressed the button. *Would you press this button to skip tomorrow?*
	Yes
	No
	*shuffle


Youâ€™ve reached the end.
