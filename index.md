Hello. I'm Jacob. 

I am currently an engineer interested in Effective Altruism.

This site houses a collection of some of my [projects and posts](/posts/).

You can find my favorite [books](/books/) and [podcasts](/podcasts/) here as well.

Here is what I've [done](/cv/) and what I'm doing [now](/now/).

Feel free to contact me via [email](mailto:mail@jacobw.xyz).
